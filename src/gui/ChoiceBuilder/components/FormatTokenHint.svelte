/**
 * Advertises the format-token autocomplete under a format field (issue #1542).
 *
 * Typing `{{` opens a list of every token, each with a one-line description, and
 * nothing in the UI said so — the reporter only found it on a hunch. The
 * affordance is two characters, so the cheapest honest fix is to name the two
 * characters, right below the caret. It doubles as the docs entry point #1541
 * deferred to this issue: the format language is the one thing you cannot guess
 * from the builder alone.
 *
 * Hidden once the value contains `{{`: the hint has done its job, and a line
 * that never goes away is the permanent chrome an "Insert token" button was
 * rejected for. Deliberately NOT persisted in settings — a per-vault flag would
 * mean a disk write from a keystroke, would not be reactive, and one stray `{{`
 * would delete the affordance vault-wide with no way back.
